# Prokaryotic Morphology and Arrangement
Study the pictures and be able to identify. Use this document to fill in your Prokaryotic Worksheet. You should be able to fill in Morphology and Arrangement and Gram Stain (in 2 weeks).
From reading your lab material, you should know the different morphology that bacteria can come in. The three we will focus on are: Coccus, Bacillus, and Spiral.
The bacteria can also come in different arrangements which is decided by the way they divide. In here, we will only look at the different arrangements of COCCUS shape bacteria.  Bacillus and spiral will only come in SINGLE, which means one cell, for this class. Use the following picture to help you decide arrangement on your Prokaryotic Worksheet.
