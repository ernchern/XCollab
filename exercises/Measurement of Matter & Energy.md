## 1: Measurement of Matter & Energy

### Matter and Measurement

(01) Rank the following items in order from smallest to largest size:

    * A peanut
    * Oxygen gas molecule
    * Carbon atom
    * A baseball
    * Grain of table salt

(02) Arrange the given units in order of magnitude from least to greatest and identity to which power of 10 they correspond to:

    * Mega
    * micro
    * centi
    * kilo
    * nano

(03) In each of the following pairs, indicate which the greater value is:

    * 10 cm or 1000 mm
    * 1 g or .01 kg
    * 100 mL or 1L
    * 10 mm or 100,000 micrometers
    * 1 Gm or 1000 km

(04) A graduated cylinder has a small amount of sand poured into the bottom. The cylinder then has exactly 10 mL of water added to it. The sand does not dissolve and the volume of the meniscus of the cylinder reads 11.7 mL. How much of the final volume is the sand?

(05) In comparing the following pairs, which has the greatest value?

    * 1.0x103 and 10,000
    * 0.0001 and 1.0x10-5
    * 5.47 and 4.2x103
    * 3.89x10-6 and 0.000000345
    * 600,001 and 6x106

(06) Of the below pairings, which represents the lesser quantity?

    * 100 mL or 100 dL
    * 1 mcg or 1 ng
    * 20 cm or 20 mm
    * 100 km or 100 Mm
    * 1000 pm or 1000 nm

(07) Convert each number into scientific notation and identify the number of significant figures.

    * 100,000,000,000,000,000
    * 60,200,000
    * 30.01
    * 0.000000004970
    * 0.000601

(08) Expand these numbers from scientific notation to conventional numbers.

    * 6.02x103
    * 3.14x10-7
    * 4.44x104
    * 2.87x1012
    * 9.87x10-2

(09) Define the following statements as being true or false.

    Bad results are only the result of poor experimental performance
    The definition of accuracy in an experiment is the ability to produce consistently similar results with repeated experiments
    If an experimentâ€™s results vary greatly between repeated performances, the results are always considered to be inaccurate
    Measuring devices must be calibrated to give accurate results
    You should always use the same measuring device throughout an experiment

(10) Identify the correct number of significant figure in the following numbers:

    * 6.02x1023
    * 140000
    * 100.1
    * 0.000001000
    * 0.0000071
